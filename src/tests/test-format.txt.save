# A TEST CONSISTS OF A TEST FILE AND A OUTPUT FILE, The test file contains INPUT CODE and output file contains EXPECTED OUTPUT of the program.
# THE BELOW GUIDE IS FOR WRITING A TEST FILE
####

# a level can be one of the values listed - `core`, `imp` or `opt`, the author of the test needs to WRITE ONLY THE WORDS GIVEN IN BRACKETS.
# if the test checks a core feature then it should be set as `core`, and same for `imp` and `opt`.
# example `core` features: parsing, compilation.
# example `opt` features: verification (checking the correctness of code).
<level: core (core) | important (imp) | optional (opt)>
